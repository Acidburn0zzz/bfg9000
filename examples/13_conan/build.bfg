# When there's a `conanfile.txt` in your source directory, `package()` can be
# used to resolve packages from conan.

zlib = package('zlib')

# Packages can be passed to the build functions, which will link the object
# with the package and add the appropriate include directories:

executable('program', files=['program.cpp'], packages=[zlib])
